                <h1>Travelling</h1>
                <p>Travelling is one of my favorite pastime activities. I love visiting new cities and exploring foreign culture. As a personal favorite, I highly recommend visiting Barcelona during the summer. There is nothing better than roaming through the streets of El Born and cooling yourself in the clear waters on the Nova Icaria beach.</p>

                <h1>Learning new languages</h1>
                <p>I find learning new languages as a both handy and fun way to broaden my knowledge. Being brought up in a bilingual household, the first languages I consider as my primary are Serbian and Macedonian. Later on, I started learning English. 12 years later, I was rewarded the C2 level CAE certificate. During those years, I also studied German and reached the C1 level. For a brief time, I started learning Slovenian but I didn't find it quite entertaining so I decided to stop. Nowadays, my latest venture is Italian!</p>

                <h1>Reading books</h1>
                <p>Books have been my lifelong passion. As a child, I enjoyed reading children's books about ancient cultures, particularly Egypt and Macedonia.As an adult, my favorite genre is historical drama. If you are a bookworm as myself, I highly recommend The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje - my favorite book.  </p>
